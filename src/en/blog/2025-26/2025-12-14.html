            <h4>Down to 2 balls, 4 runs and 5 fingers...</h4>
						<h1>A Season Opener 2025-2026</h4>
            <p>
After some shenanigans with the website entirely disappearing, Pete was able to restore all the stats *phew*.<br>Now the
website is about 46x faster at viewing stats. What do you mean it's ugly?<br>

The season schedule is out and St Peters is a newfound favourite, and we're on. The decision was made decisively to use
unpressurised balls and indecisively captains decided.</p>

<p>
	M. Hutchinson, was unaffected by the 'early season blues' was an impenetrable wall and Waught were off to a great start assisted by M. Hawke, 17
	(19). Ethan joined him at the crease they put on a solid partnership of 53 (75), before it (and Ethan's tower) was broken by Bradman's bowler
	of choice, J. March (3/27).

	I. Drury on debut (cap #177) faced the unexpected; a good delivery early (March), a genuine edge and a catch being held behind the
	stumps (yours truly) and he was off [0 (2)]. This wasn't Drury's only glimpse of
	something looking worryingly like cricket (my apologies again) but for him it set a stage for the bowl where the line of "feats of athleticism was
	toyed with"

	At 4/86 Waugh2000's great start was threatened and Drury returned to the crease at the end of the over he was
	dismissed. Drury returned with intent striking Miller (1/29) for a maximum (6 runs) on one ball and on the next loosing his leg stump to a leg break
	Drury later described in the same sentence as the 'Gatting Ball', finished at 7 (4).

	Stevens (2/36) made his return to Lords cricket in dramatic style with multiple drop catches before taking threatening
	batsmen M. Hutchinson and returning M. Hawke in two deliveries, finishing a pillar of Bradman's bowling attack.
	Waugh2000 finished at 8/122 which without pizza on the way seemed like few to chase; but Bradman1948's bowlers cannot
	be underestimated.

	The two "J.M"s debated who had the most Lords cricket experience before JMarch was sent out to open, 15 (19), with
	Miller and March working hard to steal strike from P. Wiskich. This is where the 'early season blues' kick in and
	yours truly finds himself lined up for a 3rd bat after having faced 27 deliveries. Drury made a dent with pressurised
	balls skidding nicely and pace not seen at 12.5 metres; sometimes literally not seen. At 4/18 (6ov.) he took revenge
	on a retuning Miller as revenge as well as the major offenders: March; Wiskich and B. Carbone.
	On a staircase worm-graph Bradman found themselves on the ropes at 6/83 with 5.1 ov to play.

<p>
Nervously Miller returned for the second time to join P. Wiskich with the chasers requiring 28 off 12. Wiskich
reversed early innings antics and to my relief I didn't have to face a ball in this tense chase. Scoring shots from
Over 1: 4 4 - - 4 1 (retaining). Over 2: - 2 6 ... 
<p> ..Wiskich made a fatal mistake hitting a 6 putting him at 50 (47)
total across bats and now One hand-one bounce is fully out was active at this crucial moment. Running another two,
Bradman now needed 5 runs off the final 2 deliveries. Glory presenting itself, Wiskich on reflection shouldn't have
gone big, but along the ground for an easier 2/4 runs... was caught one-hand-one-bounce, Out-and-all-out; and Innings,
caught at Mid-Off by a Stevens relieved to hold the catch. E Millard finished well with 3/29 and Waugh2000 wins by 4
runs with a delivery spare.</p>
