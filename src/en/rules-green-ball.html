				<h2>Rules</h2>
		
				
<p><strong>Here are the 7 rules and 1 principle of Lords Cricket:</strong></p>



<ol><li><strong>Teams:</strong> Two Teams of (ideally) 5 players. There can be as few as 4 on either side and as many as 6. Before the game starts, the captains should swap players between teams if necessary to ensure as close a match as possible.<br /></li><li><strong>Format:</strong> We usually follow a 25 overs per side format that can be played in 3 hours. The captains agree at the start of the game as to the maximum number of overs per side, and accordingly the maximum allowed to any one bowler. (Usually for 25-over matches it will be 7, 6, or 5 for teams of 4, 5 or 6 players respectively.)<br /></li><li><strong>Fielders:</strong> The batting team lends the fielding team any needed reserve fielders – keeping the number of fielders (including bowler and wicket-keeper) at 7 if possible at all times. Obviously the extra fielder/s must genuinely try… …to make fielding mistakes look genuine!<br /></li><li><strong>Batting order:</strong> Each team bats down to number 11 as per real cricket, and the innings is over when 10 wickets have fallen. Each player bats once (in positions 1 to 5 with 5 players), and then players have a second (and sometimes 3<sup>rd</sup>) bat; in each case the new batter is the player who (a) has had the least number of previous bats, and (b) has scored the least number of runs so far. A player making a duck in their first innings is likely to get a second and possibly third hit later on.<br />Retirements: A Batter may choose to retire, but it counts as a wicket on the scoresheet. There’s no returning and resuming the innings. However, for batting average statistics, it counts as a ‘not out’.<br /></li><li><strong>Batting down the order:</strong> When a player bats for a second time (and subsequently), as a handicap, the “one-hand-one-bounce-is-half-out” rule applies. If the batter is caught one-hand-one-bounce (except when the bounce is on the hard pitch surface), it is <em>noted</em> that they are “half-out”. The batter can still score as usual on that delivery, and the runs count. Nothing here is credited to the bowler or catcher. If this happens a second time to that batter in that particular innings, however, they are fully out, and in this instance the bowler and catcher receive full (statistical) credit for the wicket.<br /></li><li><strong>LBW:</strong>&nbsp;No player can be out LBW so long as they were (a) attempting to hit the ball <em>and</em> (b) not taking their batting stance so as to cover the stumps. A player taking guard so as to cover the stumps should be warned by the bowler beforehand.<br /></li><li><strong>Extras:</strong> A ball that passes the batter above shoulder height, or above waist height on the full, is a no-ball. Any ball which bounces off the pitch laterally is a wide, even if it returns to the pitch. One leg-side delivery is allowed per over, subsequent ones are wides. As in real cricket, no-balls and wides count as 1 extra and must be re-bowled.</li></ol>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Umpiring:</span></strong> Lord’s cricket has a long tradition of not requiring umpires, instead being based entirely on honour. That is, batters <em>walk</em> when they think they are out, bowlers or the fielding team <em>concede</em> wides / no-balls etc. The bowling team may appeal a wicket to the batter and batting team, and the batters may question whether or not a ball was a wide or no-ball – but a wicket or wide not conceded by the opposing team <em>should not be disputed</em>. The captains have an important part to play in fostering nobility and good humour and friendship between all players.</p>



<p><strong>Official Lords Cricket Games<br /></strong>For the purposes of consistency of global statistics, there are a few extra requirements for a game to qualify as a Lords Cricket match:</p>



<ol><li>It must be played with an ordinary tennis ball&nbsp;and ordinary or plastic cricket bats. If possible, the stumps should be raised by ~120mm (e.g. stood on bricks) to allow for the extra bounce.<br /></li><li>Boundaries must be at least 30m from the closest stumps. (Where a section of boundary isn’t, local rules may compensate by, for instance, awarding 2 less runs per boundary scored in that section.)<br /></li><li>The pitch should be concrete, preferably covered by synthetic turf, or of similar pace and bounce. Length of the pitch must be between 12.5m and 12.75m from crease to crease.<br /></li><li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Whatever scoring software (or paper –&nbsp;</span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230306215434/http://lordscricket.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Blank-Manual-Lords-Cricket-Scoresheet.pdf">here’s a blank template</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">) is used, it must be able to provide all the details such as on&nbsp;</span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230306215434/http://lordscricket.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/121202-Scoresheet.pdf">this example scoresheet</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">&nbsp;– including each batter’s balls-faced, fours, sixes, fall of wicket; full bowling figures; and match details such as date, time and venue.</span></li></ol>
