Led by Brother vs Brother to enable Sis v Sis and Husband v Wife.</p><p><strong>Lording</strong>, <em>Participle</em>, from Lord (Intransitive verb): To insist upon or boast about so as to act in a superior manner; To act or maintain a position in a domineering manner; To rule over. To become a stat addict; and to put individual stats above your team's goal.</p><p>None of these definitions describe this moment: One week, an Aussie dreams about cricket in the day, quickly remembering pads and helmets, disregards that nonsense and dreams of tennis balls pinging off bats in the night. He awakes with new **features &amp; stats** for Lords Cricket on his mind. By the next week he's calling 'howzat' when he reaches a hand to catch a dish at the sink. By the 3rd he's brainstorming new ways of displaying stats: for banter with his workmate (despite no more cricket). By the time the month is up he's throwing pies across the living room of his unit -- at his wife who's begrudgingly holding a bat. The final stage - he's hosting his own game of Lords Cricket well into the autumn and forcing his friends and family along. Lording - participle: <em>To be subjected to the addiction that is Lords Cricket</em>.</p><p>Weather: after 10 days of hitting &quot;refresh&quot; on forecast; and the forecast of rain facing it's own reality; Lords Cricket would go on. ANZAC day and a public holiday falls perfectly to start a weekend, I, Joshua invited along my mates, cousins, wife, parents and even grandparents as spectators for a bonus round to top off my debut season after a solitary Run-Out as a sub just wasn't enough to scratch my cricket itch. On this very grey day, a closed registration became increasingly open and players kept appearing heading down the path to the Billabong Oval. Surely all these people weren't here to play cricket on a grey autumn's day? Six debutantes and a guest player; this game had it all, including generations that truly spanned 1948 (Donald Bradman's historical English tour): Barry Rimmer through 2000 (Waugh, captaining the start of 16 win-streak): his grandson J Miller (yours truly) &amp; two grand-daughters, H &amp; S Rimmer.</p><p>Hosting my first game; I was a bit distracted and someone told me I was opening the batting for Waugh2000. An opening stand of 68 with yours truly, Joshua Miller [30 (35)] and Sam Tolhurst's efficient 27 (19) with his first career 6s looked solid until J.Miller fell, and debutante Sascha Moseley (one of two that doesn't require a first initial) got out in classic Lord's fashion, skying his second ball off his top edge to keeper Andrew I. Turner who without anyone nearby to confuse, took the catch with ease. 1/68 became 2/69 became 3/75 in a flash. 4/75 how did we get here, 5/75... a... hat-trick? Debutante H Rimmer in her inaugural over of Lords cricket had the following over:</p><hr><p>Wk 1wd 1wd 1wd 1wd 1wd 1 Wk Wk Wk 1</p><hr><p>Looking like a web-dev's nightmare; an error trying to render special characters: this over had even more. And just like that with her first five bowls on the pitch had taken four wickets immediately leaping the young H Rimmer into Lords Cricket fame finishing 4/16 and in Current Rating is at 412 leapfrogging two of her wickets; Tolhurst (#18) and Stephen Lang (#11) to fly into #8 of the Bowling Dream Team with the Strike Rate (raw) of 8. The quality of the wickets? Well this is Lords cricket. Only the most exceptional and unreproducible moments are described. Thus #2: S. Lang's bails fell; and that's most of what we know. Hit-Wicket is a brutal way to go, particularly when you're not entirely sure how your castle fell.</p><p>Hat-trick</p><p>Name</p><p>Date</p><p>1</p><p>David Lang</p><p>08/12/02</p><p>2</p><p>Stephen Lang</p><p>10/10/10</p><p>3</p><p>David Lang</p><p>05/12/10</p><p>4</p><p>David Priest</p><p>14/10/12</p><p>5</p><p>William Turner</p><p>07/12/14</p><p>6</p><p>Daniel Schwimmer</p><p>04/12/16</p><p>7</p><p>Hannah Rimmer</p><p>25/04/25</p><p>Moving on, A.I. Turner, after a shaky start with catches (to my pleasure and captain David Lang's displeasure). A.I. Turner finally warmed into it off his own bowling and took some classic catches one graceful crash landing, (improved from a &quot;whale flop&quot;--thanks Andrew), which upon rising he surprised to discover the ball in his hand and dirt in his hair. Senior Turner, taking 7 catches out of 9 wickets has been warned, but to satisfy complaints, drug tests have been demanded and the case elevated to the tribunal, directed to review his earlier drops a way of trying to skirt 'no feats of athleticism'.</p><p>Diverging briefly; Improvements to lordscricket.org.au site and stats: Thanks to P Wiskich super smarts &amp; skills (more on why he's a lad). The ball figures (or wingdings) above are a glimpse of the Ball-by-ball stat tracker, build from the digital scorecard you can re-live play-by-play (without detail of heroic or blunder) any previous games back to #105. Newer players can be compared in detail by, without influencing the fair &amp; just Lords Ranking System(TM), an option for 'Raw stats' un-obfuscating Averages and Strike Rate for noobs. <em>And</em> for Lords famed players; 'Current' &amp; 'All time' one's troubled past doesn't define their career -- except for bowler Will Turner who was always exceptional by his Player Stats History, a swanky graph shows he attained a high 400s in the summer of '11-'12 following his debut as a full player in Nov (now #24 with 513 in All Time; 2 points behind his Dad).</p><p>After all the carnage by bowler H Rimmer (&amp; the sods unfortunate enough to be caught); sister S Rimmer, 13 (13); and aunt K Miller, were left at the crease to try rebuild a foundation from two overs before (187 projected at 8.0 overs while Tolhurst and JGM were and now at 5 for: down to 150 projected) And with a runner (J.G. Miller) coming on to support his mum; That they Did. Putting on a partnership of 34 (25), with K Miller &quot;Killer&quot; putting on a handy 19 (18). S. Lang returned and surely this time: his feet at the very front of the crease. S. Lang put on an efficient 40 (25) alongside two Millers and a Rimmer; a captain's knock.</p><p>Players returning to the crease scored some crumbs; G Miller with his first Lords run, Moseley (3) and S Rimmer brought her total and thus average to 17 with a 4 n.o. (3).</p><p>Hat-Tricks aside, the pick of Bradman1948's bowlers were A.I. Turner (2/20) and D. Lang (2/36) with Waugh2000 picking their danger man Michael Thornley accurately and 'Hutchinsonned' out his 5ov., conceding just 8 runs without wicket; earning him an incredible economy of 1.6. N Wiskich created a first opportunity and Thornley set expectations unreasonably high and took the catch, earning her a first wicket.</p><p>At the 23rd over mark, S. Lang and S Rimmer were retired and the Bonus Overs (bon.Ov) began with Grandfather B.R. Rimmer and his son-in-law G Miller for two overs of no-outs; equally competitive cricket. G Miller tripled his run total with a single strike with a 2*. B.R. Rimmer took a few to find his historical form, and in a moment of brilliance mirroring his cricketing days gone by, smoked a pull-shot back of square for four runs. Rimmer and Miller rellies cheered on, as he remembered post stroke that he's 83 years old, and a bat that may support him while standing, betrayed him on the follow through; took a tumble and retired hurt to ease the mind of his watching wife. While brief, the Miller Rimmer spectators may have seen B Rimmer score his final boundary in an adventurous Lords Cricket stint; and a glorious shot it was. (Note that some may suggest a Hit-Wicket occurred; but the overwhelming evidence suggests the ball had crossed the boundary and was a dead ball before the bails came off). Mosely returned and scored a 2 bringing the Bonus Overs to a close with Waugh2000, 9:: SM 2(2); BR 4(7); GM 2(3); 1ext.; Bradman1948: HR 0/1, NW 0/8. [[Final, for merit only:: Waugh: SM 6(off 11, out twice), GM 3(off 17, out twice): Bradman: HR 4/17 (3.0), NW 1/33 (4.0).]]</p><p>With only a spot of rain so far; a full innings break brought some great food thanks to Killer including some fitting ANZACs and J.R. Miller. G. Miller, over-achieving brought a esky-full when asked to bring a couple &quot;Zeros&quot; to fuel Killer's attack.</p><p>D. Lang took on the Killer before she hurried back to the sideline to continue scoring enthusiastically; and when he tried to do the same to the next; S Moseley with a chip on his shoulder struck quickly with a wicket in 4 legal deliveries dismissing him for 15 (7).</p><p>P. Wiskich who can be awarded a few Good Lad points for forsaking a bat to give the many debutantes a go; then continuing his Lawful Good streak took a hammering to his figures against danger man Thornley. A no way cautious M Thornley returned on the scorecards, eyeing off that 6th column (&quot;6s&quot;) who's career has more of the former than 4s (34 6s vs 30 4s). After going for 13 from Thornley in an over; P. Wiskich sent him to the biscuits in the next; and conceded only a further 5 runs finishing at 2/18.</p><p>With A. Turner joining A. Turner at the crease, Ali was fashioning a fine innings and scored her first Lord's cricket boundary (four) against a surprisingly nimble G. J. Miller; until J. G. Miller his interrupted with finger-spin leg-breaks, striking thanks to the fine hands of S. Moseley, A. G Turner finishing at 11 (18). In the attack Miller made way for a Rimmer as Turner made way for Rimmer and a sibling feud began. But not before A.I. Turner, 42 (32) took the worm to it's biggest gap, as 3/65 became 4/116. Sarah Rimmer struck from the field (the only Miller or Rimmer to do so) and ran her sister Hannah Rimmer out for 8 (13), a direct hit from memory, of which she hadn't been cautioned.</p><p>G. Miller took his first wicket since possibly the 2010s and first for Lords dismissing N. Wiskich for a handy first ever innings of 7 (8) (Thanks to P. Wiskich: another couple of Good Lad points to the dad). Not a bad effort for an old Gregory; but he wasn't puffed out yet!</p><p>INSERT 8th wicket partnership here J. R. Miller not to be confused with her husband J. G. Miller came out to bat, and came out of her crease a good number of times as well; tempting S. Moseley to win fielding points time and again with stumping &quot;chances&quot;. In her three innings she scored more runs than possible stumpings, 10 (20*inc. Bon.Ov.) with honour(tm) prevailing, she was able to build a foundation for a hope of final runs to scramble Bradman1948 there.</p><p>H. Rimmer got two good starts with 8 (13) and 12 (7) finding the ropes twice. A. R. Turner (the second) was unable to convert her first innings success and Bradman1948 found themselves all out with a tall task for J.R. Miller and N. Wiskich in the two Bonus Overs. A tidy over from Mosely &amp; J.G. Miller setting his sights on getting his wife out, the bon.Ov went for 2, with wife keeping out husband as the rain picked up to a light drizzle, cooling players and confusing Adelaideians as to why it felt like the tropics. Bradman1948 was left 14 runs short and a slim victory margin by Waugh2000 was expanded slightly. <strong>bon.Ov</strong> Bradman, 2:: JRM 1(7), NW 0(4, out once, no runs deducted c&amp;b JGM): Waugh2000: SM 0/1, JGM 1/1 final for merit only:: Waugh2000+, 9/180 defeated Bradman, 10/165 : JRM 10(27) out once, NW 10(11) out three times; Waugh2000: SM: 1/28 (4.0), JGM: 2/11 (4.0).</p><p>This addition to the season that refuses to die was both remarkable and a good reminder of what Lords is about. Selfishness and statistics *AND* friends and family. The algorithm continues it's great work even with 6 debutantes; one whom achieved the highest bowling feat (ordered by embarrassment). Thanks for a great season Plus+, special thanks to Andrew with the equipment and Pete with the smarts. - &lt;JM&gt; ot a bad effort for an old Gregory; but he wasn't puffed out yet!</p></main><footer><div class="content"><div class="row"><div class="col is-center"><p></p><ul style="list-style: none;"><li typeof="Organisation" resource="/andrew">Made by <a href="/andrew" target="_blank"><span property="name">Lords Cricket Club</span></a></li><li><ul><li typeof="WebSite"><a href="https://florent_tassy.gitlab.io/polyglot-tech-blog" property="url"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-2 -2.5 24 24" width="24" fill="currentColor"><path d="M10.006 18.443L6.326 7.118h7.36l-3.68 11.325zm0 0L1.168 7.118h5.158l3.68 11.325zM1.168 7.118l8.838 11.325-9.68-7.032a.762.762 0 0 1-.276-.852l1.118-3.441zm0 0L3.385.296a.38.38 0 0 1 .724 0l2.217 6.822H1.168zm8.838 11.325l3.68-11.325h5.157l-8.837 11.325zm8.837-11.325l1.119 3.441a.762.762 0 0 1-.277.852l-9.68 7.032 8.838-11.325zm0 0h-5.157L15.902.296a.38.38 0 0 1 .725 0l2.216 6.822z"></path></svg> Demo on GitLab (theme)</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="col is-center"><a href="https://lordscricket.org.au/en/feed.xml" title="RSS feed"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-4 -4 24 24" width="24" fill="currentColor"><path d="M1.996 15.97a1.996 1.996 0 1 1 0-3.992 1.996 1.996 0 0 1 0 3.992zM1.12 7.977a.998.998 0 0 1-.247-1.98 8.103 8.103 0 0 1 9.108 8.04v.935a.998.998 0 1 1-1.996 0v-.934a6.108 6.108 0 0 0-6.865-6.06zM0 1.065A.998.998 0 0 1 .93.002C8.717-.517 15.448 5.374 15.967 13.16c.042.626.042 1.254 0 1.88a.998.998 0 1 1-1.992-.133c.036-.538.036-1.077 0-1.614C13.53 6.607 7.75 1.548 1.065 1.994A.998.998 0 0 1 0 1.064z"></path></svg></a></div><div class="col is-center" typeof="SoftwareSourceCode"><a href="https://gitlab.com/florent_tassy/polyglot-tech-blog" class="logo" property="codeRepository"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="-2 -2.5 24 24" width="24" fill="currentColor"><path d="M10.006 18.443L6.326 7.118h7.36l-3.68 11.325zm0 0L1.168 7.118h5.158l3.68 11.325zM1.168 7.118l8.838 11.325-9.68-7.032a.762.762 0 0 1-.276-.852l1.118-3.441zm0 0L3.385.296a.38.38 0 0 1 .724 0l2.217 6.822H1.168zm8.838 11.325l3.68-11.325h5.157l-8.837 11.325zm8.837-11.325l1.119 3.441a.762.762 0 0 1-.277.852l-9.68 7.032 8.838-11.325zm0 0h-5.157L15.902.296a.38.38 0 0 1 .725 0l2.216 6.822z"></path></svg> Check it out on GitLab</a></div></div></div></footer><script async src="/js/theme.js"></script></body></html>
